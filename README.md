# CopyPath
Add a "Copy Path" shortcut to any file!

# Installation

Build the project from sources. Just open the .sln in Jetbrains Rider or Visual Studio. You should find the .exe in bin/Debug or release, depending of the configuration you selected. By default it is debug.

Place the CopyPath.exe anywhere in your system. Somewhere you won't accidently delete it! When placed properly, run it as administrator.
That's it! After that, right clicking a file will suggest a "Copy Path" option. It will copy the path of right-clicked file to your clipboard.
